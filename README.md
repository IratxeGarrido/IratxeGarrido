# Hey, I'm Iratxe (she/her) 👋

**Backend Software Engineer** at [fobizz](https://fobizz.com) · Building AI-powered education tools for 650k+ educators across Germany

I write Ruby and Rails professionally and for fun. I use AI and agentic coding tools in everything I do — from daily development to side projects. Previously spent 7 years in cybersecurity (Axel Springer, Deloitte) — now I build products instead of breaking them.

- 🦆 **[Duck Dating Apps](https://app.duckdatingapps.com)** — Speed dating web app I'm building to enhance our in-person events ([repo](https://github.com/IratxeGarrido/duck-dating-apps))
- 💎 **[WNB.rb](https://www.wnb-rb.dev/)** — Europe Lead & Technical Support for the women and non-binary Ruby community. Led the Slack → Discord migration for ~2,000 members
- 👩‍🏫 **[Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/)** — Teaching web development (Rails, PostgreSQL, Git)
